            <div class="card-body">
                <p>An example of encapsulation in this project is the add method for the calculator. When <code>Calculator.add(1.0,2)</code> is called it will then call the addition class with <code>calculation = Addition.create(tuple_list)</code> from this it will call <code>Add.add()</code> where this will finally add two numbers. It will return the result cause all the previous function calls to return all the way back up the first function call which will give back the result.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h4>Inheritance</h4></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Inheritance is used in the Calculation class. When for example the Addition class is created with <code>Addition.create(tuple_list)</code> it first calls the Calculation class which will take the tuple and convert all of its items into floats and put it into a new tuple which is stored in the Calculation class. The Addition class then is created as a child of the Calculation class which allows it to inherit the tuple of floats, so it can be used to add all the items in the tuple together.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h4>Polymorphism</h4></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>One example of polymorphism being used is when the Calculation classes are being created. When the class is created it calls the function <code>convert_args_to_tuple_of_float</code> where in this method it takes the tuple that was inputted by the user and converts all the data to float. This needs to be done in the event that say the user wants to divide, but they only inputted integers but the integers don't divide evenly and require decimal points. if they were left as ints the output will only show an integer and not the decimal points.</p>

            <div class="card-header"><h4>Abstraction</h4></div>
            <div class="card-body">
                <p>Abstraction in this project is used to give the user a way to add two or more numbers at once. After the user calls the add function the program takes care of turning those numbers into floats adds them all together then returns it back to the user.</p>
